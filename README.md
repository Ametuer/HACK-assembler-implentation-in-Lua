# HACK-assembler-implentation-in-Lua
This is the implementation of an assembler for the HACK machine language for project 6 of nand2tetris. The assembler uses two arguments, the first is the folder name that contains the assembly, the second is the .asm file. The assembler creates the .hack file in the folder. Run it as :  lua assembler.lua &lt;folder_name> &lt;file.asm>
